Building and programming this device is handled by the Makefile. This project
Was written for attiny2313a, and could most likely be ported relatively easy
to other 8-bit AVR with minor source modification.

The Makefile will also burn the flash, but may require modification so that
avrdude receives the correct arguments for the particular programmer you are
using. The Makefile currently does not touch the fuse bits. These will have to
be set using avrdude, the fuse files are found in the t2313a-project-fuses
directory, along with a README file relevant to that directory.

As is typical, to build run make in this directory. To burn the program to the
chip, you will need a suitable AVR programmer. I, the developer of this project
used the usbtiny ISP programmer. If it's not obvious, I will mention that you
will be required to build a small programming board, contaning an IC socket
for the microcontroller, as well as ISP pin headers, and possibly a clock
crystal (this is necessary when your fuse bits are set to use an external clock
source).
