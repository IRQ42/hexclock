The files in this directory are provided in the unfortunate event that bad fuse
bits are set, leaving the AVR in a seemingly bricked state.

These files, with a little RTFM and a little hacking can be used to program the
fuses to their default factory state, allowing your AVR to be programmed again
using the internal RC oscillator rather than buy another $3 microcontroller.

These values are provided as a convenience, these values can be found in the
MCU datasheet as well. You are unlikely to have problems however, but mistakes
do happen occasionally.
