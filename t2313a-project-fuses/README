# WARNING -- programming the fuse bits incorrectly may brick your device, or
#            leave it in a state that it can no longer be programmed, or is
#            very difficult to restore to a state where the proper fuses can
#            be programmed. In particular fuses which select the clock source
#            can leave your avr unprogrammable, this can be fixed however by
#            providing an external clock source for the MCU while programming.
#            either an external oscillator, or an external clock signal, which
#            can be generated using a second microcontroller.


The files in this directory are to be used to set the fuse bits of attiny2313a
to the values that are required for this project, which uses an external clock
source (8.192MHz crystal oscillator), which also disables the internal 
RC oscillator.

These fuse bits must be set for the project to work with the hardware it was
intended for. After these fuses have been set, it will no longer be able to 
be programmed without an external oscillator conected to the MCU during 
programming.

Reading the source code, and the microcontroller datasheet would not be a bad
idea, and if you run into any problems where it seems your AVR has been
bricked then you will have to RTFM. I do not expect you will have any problems
with fuses if you follow this README file, using the fuse values contained
in this directory.
